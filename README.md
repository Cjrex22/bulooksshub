This is my first deployed web application, built to practice core front-end skills and explore dynamic, state-driven user interactions. This project was developed by focusing on the coding flow, embracing "vibe coding" to quickly move from concept to working feature.

🌟 Features
User Sign-up and Profiles: Users can create and manage their unique profiles.

Dynamic Two-Way Rating: Users are presented with two random profiles and can vote for their favorite with a simple click.

Real-time Interaction: The unselected profile disappears, and a new profile is instantly loaded, keeping the ranking experience smooth.

Top 10 Leaderboard: The most-voted profiles are dynamically tracked and displayed on a Top 10 Leaderboard.

Daily Reset: The Leaderboard automatically resets every 24 hours to keep the competition fresh.

🛠️ Tech Stack
This project was built primarily using foundational web technologies:

HTML: For the basic structure and semantic markup.

CSS: For styling, responsiveness, and visual appeal.

JavaScript (Basic Skill): For managing the core logic, handling user clicks, updating the profile display, and managing the Leaderboard state.

🛣️ Development Journey
This project was a significant milestone:

Deployment: This marks my first successfully deployed site.

Vibe Coding: The entire project was developed through a focused, continuous coding flow, allowing me to build features rapidly.

Skill Application: It served as a practical exercise to solidify my understanding of basic JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and fundamental front-end principles.

🔮 Future Enhancements (Ideas)
Add user authentication and secure password hashing.

Implement proper database integration instead of local storage/simple state management.

Improve profile matching algorithms.
