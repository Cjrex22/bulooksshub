This is my first successfully deployed web application, built to practice core front-end skills and explore dynamic, state-driven user interactions. The entire project was an exercise in rapid execution; approximately 60% of the features were completed using a vibe coding flow with the assistance of AI tools to maintain speed.

💡 Inspiration
The core concept for the ranking and rating algorithm was inspired by the mechanics and ideas presented in the movie, "The Social Network."

🌟 Features
User Sign-up and Profiles: Allows users to create unique profiles.

Dynamic Two-Way Rating System: Presents users with two random profiles to vote for their preference. The display updates instantly.

Top 10 Leaderboard: Profiles are tracked and ranked, with the leaderboard resetting every 24 hours.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Development
HTML & CSS: For structuring the site and design.

JavaScript (Basic Use): Only a minimal amount of JS was used to handle the core rating logic and dynamic updates.

AI Code Assistance (Vibe Coding): Utilized heavily (60% of development) to facilitate a quick, focused, and intuitive coding workflow.

🛣️ Development Milestones
Deployment: First successfully deployed web application.

Algorithm Design: Successfully implemented a dynamic ranking algorithm based on real-world inspiration.

Execution Focus: Demonstrated my ability to rapidly deliver a complex, feature-rich project with limited JS knowledge.
